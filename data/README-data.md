# Data Folder (Apple DCF)

This folder will store CSV/Excel files used in the Apple DCF model.

Planned files:
- `apple_historical_financials.csv` – downloaded or manually built from Apple 10-Ks
- `market_data.csv` – share price, market cap, beta inputs, risk-free rate inputs, etc.
- Any intermediate cleaned data for charts or sanity checks
