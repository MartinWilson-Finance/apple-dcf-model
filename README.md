# Apple DCF Model

This repo will contain my full 3-statement and discounted cash flow (DCF) model for Apple (AAPL).

## Plan / TODO

- [ ] Build historical financials and income statement shell
- [ ] Add forecast drivers and revenue build (5-year)
- [ ] Build full 3-statement integration (IS, BS, CFS)
- [ ] Calculate free cash flow and WACC
- [ ] Create base / bull / bear valuation scenarios
- [ ] Add sensitivity tables (WACC, terminal growth, margins)
- [ ] Write 1–2 page valuation summary memo
